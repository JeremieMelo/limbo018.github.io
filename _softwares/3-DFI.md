We present **[DFI](http://www.cerc.utexas.edu/utda/download/DFI/index.html)**, a fill optimization framework with multiple objectives and constraints.

* DFI Overview
  * We develop a high-performance framework for dummy fill insertion based on geometric properties instead of tiles.
  * The DFI framework optimizes multiple objectives such as density uniformity, overlay and output file sizes.
  * Experimental results show that our algorithms outperform the top teams by over 10% on ICCAD 2014 DFM contest benchmarks.
