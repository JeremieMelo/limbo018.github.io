We present **[MrDP](http://www.cerc.utexas.edu/utda/download/MrDP/index.html)**, a detailed placer that can handle multiple-row height cells in designs.

* MrDP Overview
  * A chain move scheme that generalizes the movement of heterogeneous-sized cells to optimize wirelength, cell and pin density by searching for the maximum prefix sum of the improvements.
  * A nested dynamic programming based technique solving ordered double-row placement for wirelength optimization.
  * Outperform the most recent detailed placer [TCADâ€™16 Wu](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2511141) for multiple-row height cells by 3.7% in scaled wirelength, 20.2% in cell density and 13.4% in pin density.
