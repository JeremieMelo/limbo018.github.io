I am now a postdoctoral researcher in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Texas at Austin. 
I received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin advised by Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/).
Previously, I received the B.S. in Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2013.
My research interests include physical design, machine learning applications, emerging technology in VLSI CAD, and hardware security. 
I am a recipient of 
the Best Paper Awards at DAC 2019, Integration, the VLSI Journal 2018, and SPIE Advanced Lithography Conference 2016. 

I will join *Center for Energy-Efficient Computing and Applications (CECA)* at **Peking University** in July as an assistant professor. 
I am always looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students with background in computer science, microelectronics, electronic engineering, or mathematics, working on research fields of 1) machine learning assisted design automation; 2) GPU/FPGA acceleration for CAD.
